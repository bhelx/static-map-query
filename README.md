## Static Map Query

This is a single function that turns a javascript object into a url to query google static maps. This is so small it almost shouldn't be a library.

See the single test in test.js

## Dependencies

No runtime dependencies. Uses mocha for testing.

## Test

```
mocha test.js
```

## TODO

* better tests
* polyline support
